The isomodel code uses CMake for compilation. 

Instructions for installing and compiling within WSL (Tested with WSL based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS)

- Install gcc and gdb and related accessories
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install cmake  
sudo apt install gdb

 - install and compile Google Test compile and install libraries

cd ~\git\googletest
~\git\googletest: mkdir build
~\git\googletest: cd build
~\git\googletest\build: cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF

now we install the google test libraries to the "standard" place so they are easily found

~\git\googletest\build: sudo make install

this will install stuff to /usr/local/incluge/gtest  and /usr/local/lib

- Install Boost Libraries

sudo apt install libboost-all-dev

This installs precompiled versions of the latest stable boost libraries and installs them in locations found by cmake without needing long command lines.

- Download the latest version of the isomodel from github

cd ~/git
git clone https://github.com/Argonne-National-Laboratory/ISOmodel.git

mkdir bin
cd bin
make ../src

This should run cmake and find both Boost and Gtest without having to give them on the command line.

Now you should be able to just run make and compile everything 

make
