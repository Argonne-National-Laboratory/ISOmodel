The isomodel code uses CMake for compilation. 

OSX:

- Install CMake
	To get cmake to install aliases in /usr/bin, you can run from terminal with:
	sudo /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/MacOS/CMake
	and then Tools->Install for Command Line Use
- Install Boost

To Generate the makefile:

1. Open terminal and cd to wherever you've cloned the isomodel.
2. mkdir obj then cd obj. The obj directory is where cmake will generate the makefiles and where the
actual compilation will take place. You can also call this release or debug if you want to
create separate directories for those.
3. Run: cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=(Release | Debug) ../src. If Boost is in some standard place 
such as /usr/local/include etc. then it should be found. If not you can specify where to find 
it with the flags: -DBoost_LIBRARY_DIR and -DBoost_INCLUDE_DIR

Windows:

- Install CMake.
	During the install, you can choose to add the cmake executable to the PATH. 
	Make sure to do this.
- Install Boost 32 bit and 64
- Install Visual Studio -- the free editions are fine

To generate an nmake (Visual Studio's "make") Makefile:

1. Start either the "VS2013 x64 Cross Tools Command Prompt" or the 
"VS2013 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt". These can found under Visual Studio -> Visual Studio Tools
in the start menu. The former is necessary to create a 64bit executable or library.

2. cd to wherever you cloned the isomodel to.

3. mkdir obj then cd obj. The obj directory is where cmake will generate the makefiles and where the
actual compilation will take place. You can also call this Release or Debug if you want to
create separate directories for those.

4.Run: cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=(Release | Debug) ../src -G "NMake Makefiles" -DBoost_LIBRARY_DIR=
C:/local/boost_1_55_0/lib64-msvc-12.0 -DBoost_INCLUDE_DIR=C:/local/boost_1_55_0. 
	* Choose Release or Debug as appropriate
	* Set the Boost_LIBRARY_DIR and the Boost_INCLUDE_DIR to wherever you've installed boost.
	  If you are doing a 64bit build then make sure to choose the 64bit library location.
	  
5. Run: nmake. This will build the isomodel.dll, isomodel.lib and the isomodel_standalone.exe executable. 

To generate a Visual Studio Solution using cmake:

1. Do the same as above, up to step 4.

2. Run: cmake ../src -G "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64"  -DBoost_LIBRARY_DIR=C:/local/boost_1_55_0/lib64-msvc-12.0 
-DBoost_INCLUDE_DIR=C:/local/boost_1_55_0

Remove the Win64 if you are not doing a 64bit build.
